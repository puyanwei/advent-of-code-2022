## Aim

Advent of code releases a new coding problem to solve everyday during December. It gives you points based on how quickly you solve the problem after it is released.

I don't care about that.

I'm aiming to improve my code quality, problem solving skills and readability. For me, I would consider it a failure if the way I solve the problem is not easily understandable to another developer.

As a caveat I do know that there are two parts to each question and so not thinking about scalability from the first part can make the second part more difficult/need a complete rewrite

I also use github copilot but for these challenges I turned it off.
