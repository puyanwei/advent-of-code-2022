My code solutions for Advent of Code 2022

Node setup from - https://github.com/colt/express-ts

## Aim

Advent of code releases a new coding problem to solve everyday during December. It gives you points based on how quickly you solve the problem after it is released.

I don't care about that.

I'm aiming to just improve my code quality and problem solving skills.

As a caveat I do know that there are two parts to each question and so not thinking about scalability from the first part can make the second part more difficult/need a complete rewrite

I also use github copilot but for these challenges I turned it off.
